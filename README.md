# Creative-Writing-Assistant
This C++ program is a tool designed to aid creative writers in their writing process. The program prompts the user to input a sentence with starting and ending quotation marks. Once the sentence is submitted, the program determines if the sentence entered is either a passive or an active sentence. The program then continues, prompting the user with the options to either convert the passive sentence into an active sentence or convert the active sentence into a passive sentence. If either option is selected, the program prompts the user with their now converted sentence. Once completed, the program asks the user if there is another sentence that they'd like to enter to determine if it is passive or active. If the user enters 'yes', the program will continue, looping back to determine if the sentence is either passive or active. If the user enters 'no', the program will end.

The program includes functions `isPassive`, `convertPassiveToActive`, and `convertActiveToPassive` which can be improved to better handle different types of sentences. These functions can be modified according to the user's needs.

This program serves as a useful tool for creative writers, allowing them to easily identify and convert between passive and active sentences in their writing. By providing this functionality, the program can help writers improve their writing skills and produce more engaging and effective content.
